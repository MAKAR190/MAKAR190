### About me
Hello, my name is Makar and I am Full Stack Web JavaScript developer (React/Next, NodeJs/Express, Typescript/NestJs).I have a long history with being involved with coding, started when I was about 12 years old. I saw a facebook ad with front-end development crash course, where I had my first experience. Before it I didn't think that coding is so interesting! There I made a lot of landing pages as course projects. Then I went on back-end course with node js and became a full-stack developer. All courses I had from 2019 to 2022. After all years of these courses I am glad that I have finished them. And know I understand that facebook is more useful thing than I used to think ðŸ˜„
I have already made one commercial website - [Iulian Boiko](https://iulianboiko.com) for ukrainian snooker player. Here is my [LinkedIn profile](https://ua.linkedin.com/in/makar-lutskyi-634991208). So I really love my job
